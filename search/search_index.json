PySceneDetect is a tool for detecting shot changes in videos ( example ), and can automatically split the video into separate clips . PySceneDetect is free and open-source software, and has several detection methods to find fast-cuts and threshold-based fades. Quickstart Split video on each fast cut using command line (more examples) : scenedetect -i video.mp4 split-video Split video on each fast cut using Python API (docs) : from scenedetect import detect, AdaptiveDetector, split_video_ffmpeg scene_list = detect('my_video.mp4', AdaptiveDetector()) split_video_ffmpeg('my_video.mp4', scene_list) Examples and Use Cases Here are some of the things people are using PySceneDetect for: splitting home videos or other source footage into individual scenes automated detection and removal of commercials from PVR-saved video sources processing and splitting surveillance camera footage statistical analysis of videos to find suitable \"loops\" for looping GIFs/cinemagraphs academic analysis of film and video (e.g. finding mean shot length) Of course, this is just a small slice of what you can do with PySceneDetect, so why not try it out for yourself ! The timecode format used by default ( HH:MM:SS.nnnn ) is compatible with most popular video tools, so in most cases the output scene list from PySceneDetect can be directly copied and pasted into another tool of your choice (e.g. ffmpeg , avconv or the mkvtoolnix suite).","title":"Home"},{"location":"api/","text":"API Reference The Python API is documented using Sphinx and can be found here . Scene Detection Algorithms This page discusses the scene detection methods/algorithms available for use in PySceneDetect, including details describing the operation of the detection method, as well as relevant command-line arguments and recommended values. Content-Aware Detector The content-aware scene detector ( detect-content ) detects jump cuts in the input video. This is typically what people think of as \"cuts\" between scenes in a movie - given two adjacent frames, do they belong to the same scene? The content-aware scene detector finds areas where the difference between two subsequent frames exceeds the threshold value that is set (a good value to start with is --threshold 27 ). Internally, this detector functions by converting the colorspace of each decoded frame from RGB into HSV . It then takes the average difference across all channels (or optionally just the value channel) from frame to frame. When this exceeds a set threshold, a scene change is triggered. detect-content also has edge detection, which can be enabled by providing a set of 4 numbers in the form ( delta_hue , delta_sat , delta_lum , delta_edges ). Changes in edges are typically larger than the other components, so threshold may need to be increased accordingly. For example, -w 1.0 0.5 1.0 0.2 -t 32 is a good starting point to use with edge detection. The default weights are --weights 1.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 which does not include edges, but this may change in the future. See the documentation for detect-content for details. Adaptive Content Detector The adaptive content detector ( detect-adaptive ) compares the difference in content between adjacent frames similar to detect-content but instead using a rolling average of adjacent frame changes. This helps mitigate false detections where there is fast camera motion. Threshold Detector The threshold-based scene detector ( detect-threshold ) is how most traditional scene detection methods work (e.g. the ffmpeg blackframe filter), by comparing the intensity/brightness of the current frame with a set threshold, and triggering a scene cut/break when this value crosses the threshold. In PySceneDetect, this value is computed by averaging the R, G, and B values for every pixel in the frame, yielding a single floating point number representing the average pixel value (from 0.0 to 255.0). Histogram Detector The scene change detection algorithm uses histograms of the Y channel in the YCbCr color space to detect scene changes, which helps mitigate issues caused by lighting variations. Each frame of the video is converted from its original color space to the YCbCr color space.The Y channel, which represents luminance, is extracted from the YCbCr color space. This helps in focusing on intensity variations rather than color variations. A histogram of the Y channel is computed using the specified number of bins (--bins/-b). The histogram is normalized to ensure that it can be consistently compared with histograms from other frames. The normalized histogram of the current frame is compared with the normalized histogram of the previous frame using the correlation method (cv2.HISTCMP_CORREL). A scene change is detected if the correlation between the histograms of consecutive frames is below the specified threshold (--threshold/-t). This indicates a significant change in luminance, suggesting a scene change. Perceptual Hash Detector The perceptual hash detector ( detect-hash ) calculates a hash for a frame and compares that hash to the previous frame's hash. If the hashes differ by more than the defined threshold, then a scene change is recorded. The hashing algorithm used for this detector is an implementation of phash from the imagehash library. In practice, this detector works similarly to detect-content in that it picks up large differences between adjacent frames. One important note is that the hashing algorithm converts the frames to grayscale, so this detector is insensitive to changes in colors if the brightness remains constant. In general, this algorithm is very computationally efficient compared to detect-content or detect-adaptive , especially if downscaling is not used. See here for an overview of how a perceptual hashing algorithm can be used for detecting similarity (or otherwise) of images and a visual depiction of the algorithm. Creating New Detection Algorithms All scene detection algorithms must inherit from the base SceneDetector class . Note that the current SceneDetector API is under development and expected to change somewhat before v1.0 is released, so make sure to pin your scenedetect dependency to the correct API version (e.g. scenedetect < 0.6 , scenedetect < 0.7 , etc...). Creating a new scene detection method can be as simple as implementing the process_frame function, and optionally post_process : from scenedetect.scene_detector import SceneDetector class CustomDetector(SceneDetector): \"\"\"CustomDetector class to implement a scene detection algorithm.\"\"\" def __init__(self): pass def process_frame(self, frame_num, frame_img, frame_metrics, scene_list): \"\"\"Computes/stores metrics and detects any scene changes. Returns: A list containing 1 or more the frame numbers of any detected scenes. \"\"\" return [] def post_process(self, scene_list): pass process_frame is called on every frame in the input video, which will be called after the final frame of the video is passed to process_frame . This may be useful for multi-pass algorithms, or detectors which are waiting on some condition but still wish to output an event on the final frame. For example, a detector may output at most 1 cuts for every call to process_frame , it may output the entire scene list in post_process , or a combination of both. Note that the latter will not work in cases where a live video stream or camera input device is being used. See the API documentation for the SceneDetector class for details. Alternatively, you can call help(SceneDetector) from a Python REPL. For examples of actual detection algorithm implementations, see the source files in the scenedetect/detectors/ directory (e.g. threshold_detector.py , content_detector.py ). Processing is done by calling the process_frame(...) function for all frames in the video, followed by post_process(...) (optional) after the final frame. Scene cuts are detected and added to the passed list object in both cases. process_frame(...) is called for each frame in sequence, passing the following arguments: frame_num : the number of the current frame being processed frame_img : frame returned video file or stream (accessible as NumPy array) frame_metrics : dictionary for memoizing results of detection algorithm calculations for quicker subsequent analyses (if possible) scene_list : List containing the frame numbers where all scene cuts/breaks occur in the video. post_process(...) is called after the final frame has been processed, to allow for any stored scene cuts to be written if required (e.g. in the case of the ThresholdDetector ). You may also want to look into the implementation of current detectors to understand how frame metrics are saved/loaded to/from a StatsManager for caching and allowing values to be written to a stats file for users to graph and find trends in to tweak detector options. Also see the documentation for the SceneManager for details.","title":"Python API"},{"location":"api/#api-reference","text":"The Python API is documented using Sphinx and can be found here .","title":"API Reference"},{"location":"api/#scene-detection-algorithms","text":"This page discusses the scene detection methods/algorithms available for use in PySceneDetect, including details describing the operation of the detection method, as well as relevant command-line arguments and recommended values.","title":"Scene Detection Algorithms"},{"location":"api/#content-aware-detector","text":"The content-aware scene detector ( detect-content ) detects jump cuts in the input video.

The new minimum Python version is now 3.6 . See the Migration Guide for information on how to port existing applications to the new API. Most users will see performance improvements after updating, and changes to the command-line are not expected to break most workflows. The main goals of v0.6 are reliability and performance. To achieve this required several breaking changes. The video input API was refactored, and many technical debt items were addressed. This should help the eventual transition to the first planned stable release (v1.0) where the goal is an improved scene detection API. Both the Windows installer and portable distributions now include signed executables. Many thanks to SignPath, AppVeyor, and AdvancedInstaller for their support. Changelog Overview: Major performance improvements on multicore systems Configuration file support via command line option or user settings folder Support for multiple video backends, PyAV is now supported in addition to OpenCV Breaking API changes to VideoManager (replaced with VideoStream ), StatsManager , and save_images() See the Migration Guide for details on how to update from v0.5.x A backwards compatibility layer has been added to prevent most applications from breaking, will be removed in a future release Support for Python 2.7 has been dropped, minimum supported Python version is 3.6 Support for OpenCV 2.x has been dropped, minimum OpenCV version is 3.x Windows binaries are now signed, thanks SignPath.io (certificate by SignPath Foundation ) Command-Line Changes: Configuration files are now supported, see documentation for details Can specify config file path with -c / --config , or create a scenedetect.cfg file in your user config folder Frame numbers are now 1-based, aligning with most other tools (e.g. ffmpeg ) and video editors ( #265 ) Start/end frame numbers of adjacent scenes no longer overlap ( #264 ) End/duration timecodes still include the frame's presentation time Add --merge-last-scene option to merge last scene if shorter than --min-scene-len Add -b / --backend option to use a specific video decoding backend Supported backends are opencv and pyav Run scenedetect help to see a list of backends available on the current system Both backends are included with Windows builds split-video command: -c / --copy now uses ffmpeg instead of mkvmerge ( #77 , #236 ) Add -m / --mkvmerge flag to use mkvmerge instead of ffmpeg ( #77 ) Long name for -a has been changed to --args (from --override-args ) detect-adaptive command: --drop-short-scenes now works properly with detect-adaptive detect-content command: Default threshold -t / --threshold lowered to 27 to be more sensitive to shot changes ( #246 ) Add override for global -m / --min-scene-len option detect-threshold command: Remove -p / --min-percent and -b / --block-size options Add override for global -m / --min-scene-len option save-images command now works when -i / --input is an image sequences Default backend (OpenCV) is more robust to video decoder failures -i / --input may no longer be specified multiple times, if required use an external tool (e.g. ffmpeg , mkvmerge ) to perform concatenation before processing -s / --stats no longer loads existing statistics and will overwrite any existing files -l / --logfile now respects -o / --output -v / --verbosity now takes precedence over -q / --quiet API Changes: New detect() function performs scene detection on a video path, see example here New open_video() function to handle video input, see example here split_video_ffmpeg() and split_video_mkvmerge() now take a single path as input save_images() no longer accepts downscale_factor Use scale or height / width arguments to resize images New VideoStream replaces VideoManager ( #213 ) Supports both OpenCV ( VideoStreamCv2 ) and PyAV ( VideoStreamAv ) Improves video seeking invariants, especially around defining what frames 0 and 1 mean for different time properties ( frame_number is 1-based whereas position is 0-based to align with PTS) See test_time_invariants in tests/test_video_stream.py as a reference of specific behaviours Changes to SceneManager : detect_scenes() now performs video decoding in a background thread, improving performance on most systems SceneManager is now responsible for frame downscaling via the downscale / auto_downscale properties detect_scenes() no longer shows a progress bar by default, set show_progress=True to restore the previous behaviour clear() now clears detectors, as they may be stateful get_scene_list() now returns an empty list if there are no detected cuts, specify start_in_scene=True for previous behavior (one scene spanning the entire input) Changes to StatsManager : save_to_csv() now accepts a path or an open file handle base_timecode argument has been removed from save_to_csv() load_from_csv() is now deprecated and will be removed in v1.0 Changes to FrameTimecode : Use rounding instead of truncation when calculating frame numbers to fix incorrect round-trip conversions and improve accuracy ( #268 ) Fix previous_frame() generating negative frame numbers in some cases FrameTimecode objects can now perform arithmetic with formatted strings, e.g. 'HH:MM:SS.nnn' Merged constants MAX_FPS_DELTA and MINIMUM_FRAMES_PER_SECOND_DELTA_FLOAT in scenedetect.frame_timecode into new MAX_FPS_DELTA constant video_manager parameter has been removed from the AdaptiveDetector constructor split_video_ffmpeg and split_video_mkvmerge function arguments have been renamed and defaults updated: suppress_output is now show_output , default is False hide_progress is now show_progress , default is False block_size argument has been removed from the ThresholdDetector constructor calculate_frame_score method of ContentDetector has been renamed to _calculate_frame_score , use new module-level function of the same name instead get_aspect_ratio has been removed from scenedetect.platform (use the aspect_ratio property of a VideoStream instead) Backwards compatibility with v0.5 to avoid breaking most applications on release while still allowing performance improvements Python Distribution Changes v0.6.0.3 - Fix missing package description v0.6.0.2 - Improve error messaging when OpenCV is not installed v0.6.0.1 - Fix original v0.6 release requiring av to run the scenedetect command Known Issues URL inputs are not supported by the save-images or split-video commands Variable framerate videos (VFR) are not fully supported, and will yield incorrect timestamps ( #168 ) The detect-threshold option -l / --add-last-scene cannot be disabled Due to a switch from EXE to MSI for the Windows installer, you may have to uninstall older versions first before installing v0.6 PySceneDetect 0.5 0.5.6.1 (October 11, 2021) Fix crash when using detect-content or detect-adaptive with latest version of OpenCV (thanks @bilde2910) 0.5.6 (August 15, 2021) Release Notes New detection algorithm : detect-adaptive which works similar to detect-content , but with reduced false negatives during fast camera movement (thanks @scarwire and @wjs018) Images generated by save-images can now be resized via the command line Statsfiles now work properly with detect-threshold Removed the -p / --min-percent option from detect-threshold Add new option -l / --luma-only to detect-content / detect-adaptive to only consider brightness channel (useful for greyscale videos) Changelog [feature] New adaptive content detector algorithm detect-adaptive ( #153 ,

change including better performance, configuration file support, and a more ergonomic API. The new minimum Python version is now 3.6 . See the Migration Guide for information on how to port existing applications to the new API. Most users will see performance improvements after updating, and changes to the command-line are not expected to break most workflows. The main goals of v0.6 are reliability and performance. To achieve this required several breaking changes. The video input API was refactored, and many technical debt items were addressed. This should help the eventual transition to the first planned stable release (v1.0) where the goal is an improved scene detection API. Both the Windows installer and portable distributions now include signed executables. Many thanks to SignPath, AppVeyor, and AdvancedInstaller for their support.","title":"Release Notes"},{"location":"changelog/#changelog_3","text":"Overview: Major performance improvements on multicore systems Configuration file support via command line option or user settings folder Support for multiple video backends, PyAV is now supported in addition to OpenCV Breaking API changes to VideoManager (replaced with VideoStream ), StatsManager , and save_images() See the Migration Guide for details on how to update from v0.5.x A backwards compatibility layer has been added to prevent most applications from breaking, will be removed in a future release Support for Python 2.7 has been dropped, minimum supported Python version is 3.6 Support for OpenCV 2.x has been dropped, minimum OpenCV version is 3.x Windows binaries are now signed, thanks SignPath.io (certificate by SignPath Foundation ) Command-Line Changes: Configuration files are now supported, see documentation for details Can specify config file path with -c / --config , or create a scenedetect.cfg file in your user config folder Frame numbers are now 1-based, aligning with most other tools (e.g. ffmpeg ) and video editors ( #265 ) Start/end frame numbers of adjacent scenes no longer overlap ( #264 ) End/duration timecodes still include the frame's presentation time Add --merge-last-scene option to merge last scene if shorter than --min-scene-len Add -b / --backend option to use a specific video decoding backend Supported backends are opencv and pyav Run scenedetect help to see a list of backends available on the current system Both backends are included with Windows builds split-video command: -c / --copy now uses ffmpeg instead of mkvmerge ( #77 , #236 ) Add -m / --mkvmerge flag to use mkvmerge instead of ffmpeg ( #77 ) Long name for -a has been changed to --args (from --override-args ) detect-adaptive command: --drop-short-scenes now works properly with detect-adaptive detect-content command: Default threshold -t / --threshold lowered to 27 to be more sensitive to shot changes ( #246 ) Add override for global -m / --min-scene-len option detect-threshold command: Remove -p / --min-percent and -b / --block-size options Add override for global -m / --min-scene-len option save-images command now works when -i / --input is an image sequences Default backend (OpenCV) is more robust to video decoder failures -i / --input may no longer be specified multiple times, if required use an external tool (e.g. ffmpeg , mkvmerge ) to perform concatenation before processing -s / --stats no longer loads existing statistics and will overwrite any existing files -l / --logfile now respects -o / --output -v / --verbosity now takes precedence over -q / --quiet API Changes: New detect() function performs scene detection on a video path, see example here New open_video() function to handle video input, see example here split_video_ffmpeg() and split_video_mkvmerge() now take a single path as input save_images() no longer accepts downscale_factor Use scale or height / width arguments to resize images New VideoStream replaces VideoManager ( #213 ) Supports both OpenCV ( VideoStreamCv2 ) and PyAV ( VideoStreamAv ) Improves video seeking invariants, especially around defining what frames 0 and 1 mean for different time properties ( frame_number is 1-based whereas position is 0-based to align with PTS) See test_time_invariants in tests/test_video_stream.py as a reference of specific behaviours Changes to SceneManager : detect_scenes() now performs video decoding in a background thread, improving performance on most systems SceneManager is now responsible for frame downscaling via the downscale / auto_downscale properties detect_scenes() no longer shows a progress bar by default, set show_progress=True to restore the previous behaviour clear() now clears detectors, as they may be stateful get_scene_list() now returns an empty list if there are no detected cuts, specify start_in_scene=True for previous behavior (one scene spanning the entire input) Changes to StatsManager : save_to_csv() now accepts a path or an open file handle base_timecode argument has been removed from save_to_csv() load_from_csv() is now deprecated and will be removed in v1.0 Changes to FrameTimecode : Use rounding instead of truncation when calculating frame numbers to fix incorrect round-trip conversions and improve accuracy ( #268 ) Fix previous_frame() generating negative frame numbers in some cases FrameTimecode objects can now perform arithmetic with formatted strings, e.g. 'HH:MM:SS.nnn' Merged constants MAX_FPS_DELTA and MINIMUM_FRAMES_PER_SECOND_DELTA_FLOAT in scenedetect.frame_timecode into new MAX_FPS_DELTA constant video_manager parameter has been removed from the AdaptiveDetector constructor split_video_ffmpeg and split_video_mkvmerge function arguments have been renamed and defaults updated: suppress_output is now show_output , default is False hide_progress is now show_progress , default is False block_size argument has been removed from the ThresholdDetector constructor calculate_frame_score method of ContentDetector has been renamed to _calculate_frame_score , use new module-level function of the same name instead get_aspect_ratio has been removed from scenedetect.platform (use the aspect_ratio property of a VideoStream instead)

Let's split this scene into clips on each fast cut. This means we need to use content-aware detecton mode ( detect-content ) or adaptive mode ( detect-adaptive ). If the video instead contains fade-in/fade-out transitions you want to find, you can use detect-threshold instead. If no detector is specified, detect-adaptive will be used by default. Let's first save a scene list in CSV format and generate some images of each scene to check the output: scenedetect --input goldeneye.mp4 detect-adaptive list-scenes save-images Running the above command, in the working directory, you should see a file goldeneye-Scenes.csv , as well as individual frames for the start/middle/end of each scene starting with goldeneye-Scene-001-01.jpg . The results should appear as follows: Scene # Start Time Preview 1 00:00:00.000 2 00:00:03.754 3 00:00:08.759 4 00:00:10.802 5 00:00:15.599 6 00:00:27.110 7 00:00:34.117 8 00:00:36.536 ... ... ... 18 00:01:06.316 19 00:01:10.779 20 00:01:18.036 21 00:01:19.913 22 00:01:21.999 Splitting Video into Clips The split-video command can be used to automatically split the input video using ffmpeg or mkvmerge . For example: scenedetect -i goldeneye.mp4 split-video Type scenedetect split-video --help for a full list of options which can be specified for video splitting, including high quality mode ( -hq/--high-quality ) or copy mode ( -c/--copy ). You can also specify -h / --high-quality to produces near lossless results, or -p / --preset and -crf / --rate-factor (call scenedetect help split-video for details). If either -c / --copy or -m / --mkvmerge is specified, codec copying mode is used, at the expense of frame accurate cuts. Optionally, you can also specify the x264 -p / --preset and -crf / --rate-factor (see scenedetect split-video --help for details). Detection Methods PySceneDetect can look for fades in/out using detect-threshold (comparing each frame to a set black level) or find fast cuts using detect-content (compares each frame looking for changes in content). There also is detect-adaptive , which uses the same scoring as detect-content , but compares the ratio of each frame score to its neighbors. Each mode has slightly different parameters, and is described in detail below. Most detector parameters can also be set with a config file . In general, use detect-threshold mode if you want to detect scene boundaries using fades/cuts in/out to black. If the video uses a lot of fast cuts between content, and has no well-defined scene boundaries, you should use the detect-adaptive or detect-content modes. Once you know what detection mode to use, you can try the parameters recommended below, or generate a statistics file (using the -s / --stats flag) in order to determine the correct parameters - specifically, the proper threshold value. Content-Aware Detection Unlike threshold mode, content-aware mode looks at the difference between each pair of adjacent frames, triggering a scene break when this difference exceeds the threshold value. The optimal threshold can be determined by generating a stats file ( -s ), opening it with a spreadsheet editor (e.g. Excel), and examining the content_val column ( example ). This value should be very small between similar frames, and grow large when a big change in content is noticed (look at the values near frame numbers/times where you know a scene change occurs). The threshold value should be set so that most scenes fall below the threshold value, and scenes where changes occur should exceed the threshold value (thus triggering a scene change). Threshold Detection Threshold-based mode is what most traditional scene detection programs use, which looks at the average intensity of the current frame, triggering a scene break when the intensity falls below the threshold (or crosses back upwards). The default threshold when using the detect-threshold is 12 (e.g. detect-threshold is the same as detect-threshold --threshold 12 when the -t / --threshold option is not supplied), which is a good value to try when detecting fade outs to black on most videos. scenedetect -i my_video.mp4 -s my_video.stats.mp4 detect-threshold scenedetect -i my_video.mp4 -s my_video.stats.mp4 detect-threshold -t 20 Using values for threshold less than 8 may cause problems with some videos, especially those encoded at lower bitrates or with limited dynamic range. The optimal threshold can be determined by generating a statsfile ( -s ), opening it with a spreadsheet editor (e.g. Excel), and examining the delta_rgb column. These values represent the average intensity of the pixels for that particular frame (taken by averaging the R, G, and B values over the whole frame). The threshold value should be set so that the average intensity of most frames in content scenes lie above the threshold value, and scenes where scene changes/breaks occur should fall under the threshold value (thus triggering a scene change). Adaptive Detection The detect-adaptive mode compares each frame's score as calculated by detect-content with its neighbors. This score is what forms the adaptive_ratio metric in the statsfile. You can also configure the amount of neighboring frames via the frame-window option, as well as the minimum change in content_val score using min-content-val . Detection Parameters Detectors take a variety of parameters, which can be configured via command-line or by using a config file . If the default parameters do not produce correct results, you can generate a stats file using the -s / --stats option. For example, with detect-content , if the default threshold of 27 does not produce correct results, we can determine the proper threshold by first generating a stats file: scenedetect --input goldeneye.mp4 --stats goldeneye.stats.csv detect-adaptive We can then plot the values of the content_val column: The peaks in values correspond to the scene breaks in the input video. In some cases the threshold may need to be raised or lowered accordingly. Saving Image Previews of Detected Scenes PySceneDetect can automatically save the beginning and ending frame of each detected scene by using the save-images command. If present, the first and last frames of each scene will be saved in the current working directory, using the filename of the input video. Files marked 00 represent the starting frame of the scene, and those marked 01 represent the last frame (e.g. testvideo.mp4.Scene-4-01.jpg ). By default, two images are generated. Coming soon: If more are specified via the -n flag, they will start from 00 (the first frame) and be evenly spaced throughout the scene until the last frame, which will be numbered N-1 . Improving Processing Speed/Performance The following arguments are global program options, and need to be applied before any commands (e.g. detect-content , list-scenes ). They can be used to achieve performance gains for some source material with a variable loss of accuracy. Assuming the input video is of a high enough resolution, a significant performance gain can be achieved by sub-sampling (down-scaling) the input image by a specific integer factor (2x, 3x, 4x, 5x...). This is applied automatically to some degree based on the input video size, but can be overridden manually with the -d / --downscale option. This factor represents how many pixels are \"skipped\" in both the x- and y- directions, effectively down-scaling the image (using nearest-neighbor sampling) by the factor specified (the new resolution being W/factor x H/factor if the old resolution is W x H ). Another method that can be used to gain a performance boost is frame skipping. This method, however, severely reduces frame-accurate scene cuts, so it should only be used with high FPS material (ideally > 60 FPS), at low values (try not to exceed a value of 1 or 2 if using -fs / --frame-skip ), in cases where this is acceptable. Using the frame skip option also disallows the use of a stats file, which offsets the speed gain if the same video needs to be processed multiple times (e.g. to determine the optimal threshold). The option still remains, however, for the set of cases where it is still required. For example, if we skip every other frame (e.g. using --frame-skip 1 ), the processing speed should roughly double. If set too large, enough frames may be skipped each time that the threshold is met during every iteration, continually triggering scene changes. This is because frame skipping essentially raises the threshold between frames in the same scene (making them more likely to appear as cuts ) while not affecting the threshold between frames of different scenes. This makes the two harder to distinguish, and can cause additional false scene cuts to be detected. While this can be compensated for by raising the threshold value, this increases the probability of missing a real/true scene cut - thus, the use of the -fs / --frame-skip option is discouraged. Seeking, Duration, and Setting Start / Stop Times Specifying the time command allows control over what portion of the video PySceneDetect processes. The time command accepts three options: start time ( -s / -start ), end time ( -e / -end ), and duration ( -d / --duration ). Specifying both end time and duration is redundant, and in this case, duration overrides end time. Timecodes can be given in seconds ( 100.0 ), frames (no decimal place, 100 ), or timecode as HH:MM:SS[.nnn] ( 12:34:56.789 ). For example, let's say we have a video shot at 30 FPS, and want to analyze only the segment from the 5 to the 6.5 minute mark in the video (we want to analyze the 90 seconds [2700 frames] between 00:05:00 and 00:06:30). The following commands are all thus equivalent in this regard (assuming we are using the content detector): scenedetect -i my_video.mp4 time --start 00:05:00 --end 00:06:30 scenedetect -i my_video.mp4 time --start 300s --end 390s scenedetect -i my_video.mp4 time --start 300s --duration 90s scenedetect -i my_video.mp4 time --start 300s --duration 2700 This demonstrates the different timecode formats, interchanging end time with duration and vice-versa, and precedence of setting duration over end time. Config File A configuration file path can be specified using the -c / --config argument. PySceneDetect also looks for a config file named scenedetect.cfg in one of the following locations: Windows: C:/Users/%USERNAME%/AppData/Local/PySceneDetect/scenedetect.cfg Linux: ~/.config/PySceneDetect/scenedetect.cfg $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/scenedetect.cfg Mac: ~/Library/Preferences/PySceneDetect/scenedetect.cfg Run scenedetect --help to see the exact path on your system which will be used (it will be listed under the help text for the -c/--config option). You can click here to download a scenedetect.cfg config file to use as a template. Note that lines starting with a # are comments and will be ignored. The scenedetect.cfg template file is also available in the folder where PySceneDetect is installed. Specifying a config file path using -c/--config overrides the user config file. Specifying values on the command line will override those values in the config file. The syntax of a configuration file is: [command] option_a = value #comment option_b = 1 Example [global] default-detector = detect-content min-scene-len = 0.8s [detect-content] threshold = 32 weights = 1.0 0.5 1.0 0.2 [split-video] preset = slow rate-factor = 17 # Don't need to use quotes even if filename contains spaces filename = $VIDEO_NAME-Clip-$SCENE_NUMBER [save-images] format = jpeg quality = 80 num-images = 3 See the scenedetect.cfg file in the location you installed PySceneDetect or download it from Github for a complete listing of all configuration options. Video Splitting Requirements PySceneDetect can use either ffmpeg or mkvmerge to split videos automatically. By default, when specifying the split-video command, ffmpeg will be used to split the video. If the -c / --copy option is also set (e.g. split-video --copy ), mkvmerge will be used to split the video instead. FFmpeg You can download ffmpeg from: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html Note that Linux users should use a package manager (e.g. sudo apt-get install ffmpeg ). Windows users may require additional steps in order for PySceneDetect to detect ffmpeg - see the section Manually Enabling split-video Support below for details. mkvmerge You can download and install mkvmerge as part of the mkvtoolnix package from: https://mkvtoolnix.download/downloads.html Note that Windows users should use the installer/setup, and Linux users should use their system package manager, otherwise PySceneDetect may not be able to find mkvmerge . If this is the case, see the section below to enable support for the split-video --copy command manually. Enabling split-video Support If PySceneDetect cannot find the respective tool installed on your system, you have three options: Place the tool in the same location that PySceneDetect is installed (e.g. copy and paste mkvmerge.exe into the same place scenedetect.exe is located). This is the easiest solution for most users. Add the directory where you installed ffmpeg/mkvmerge to your system's PATH environment variable, ensuring that you can use the ffmpeg/mkvmerge command from any terminal/command prompt. This is the best solution for advanced users. Place the tool in a location already in your system's PATH variable (e.g. C:/Windows). This is not recommended, but may be the only solution on systems without administrative rights.","title":"Command-Line"},{"location":"cli/#pyscenedetect-cli","text":"See the documentation for a complete reference to the scenedetect command with more examples.","title":"PySceneDetect CLI"},{"location":"cli/#quickstart","text":"Split input video on each fast cut using ffmpeg : scenedetect -i video.mp4 split-video Save some frames from each cut: scenedetect -i video.mp4 save-images Skip the first 10 seconds of the input video: scenedetect -i video.mp4 time -s 10s","title":"Quickstart"},{"location":"cli/#example","text":"As a concrete example to become familiar with PySceneDetect, let's use the following short clip from the James Bond movie, GoldenEye (Copyright \u00a9 1995 MGM): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMgIPnCnlbQ You can download the clip from here (right-click and save the video in your working directory as goldeneye.mp4 ).

Anyone who is able to contribute in any capacity to these items is encouraged to do so by starting a dialogue by opening a new issue on Github as per above. Flash Suppression Some detection methods struggle with bright flashes and fast camera movement. The detection pipeline has some filters in place to deal with these cases, but there are still drawbacks. We are actively seeking methods which can improve both performance and accuracy in these cases. Automatic Thresholding The detect-content command requires a manual threshold to be set currently. Methods to use peak detection to dynamically determine when scene cuts occur would allow for the program to work with a much wider amount of material without requiring manual tuning, but would require statistical analysis. Ideally, this would be something like -threshold=auto as a default. Dissolve Detection Depending on the length of the dissolve and parameters being used, detection accuracy for these types of cuts can vary widely. A method to improve accuracy with minimal performance loss is an open problem. Advanced Strategies Research into detection methods and performance are ongoing. All contributions in this regard are most welcome. GUI A graphical user interface will be crucial for making PySceneDetect approchable by a wider audience. There have been several suggested designs, but nothing concrete has been developed yet. Any proposed solution for the GUI should work across Windows, Linux, and OSX. Localization PySceneDetect currently is not localized for other languages.

You need to install OpenCV for PySceneDetect to properly work.

You can also use the headless package if you're running a server: pip install scenedetect[opencv-headless] Unlike calling pip install opencv-python , the above commands will download and install the correct OpenCV version based on the Python version you are running. How can I enable video splitting support? Video splitting is performed by ffmpeg ( https://ffmpeg.org/download.html ) or mkvmerge (https://mkvtoolnix.download/downloads.html) depending on which command line arguments are used. Ensure the tool is available and somewhere in your system's PATH folder. How can I fix the error Cannot split video due to too many scenes ? This error occurs on Windows platforms specifically when the number of detected scenes is too large. This is because PySceneDetect internally invokes other commands, such as those used for the split-video command. You can get around this issue by simply invoking those tools manually, using a smaller sub-set of scenes (or splitting the scene list into multiple parts). You can obtain a comma-separated list of timecodes by using the list-scenes command. See Issue #164 for details, or if you have any further questions. How can I fix the error Failed to read any frames from video file ? Unfortunately, the underlying library used to perform video I/O was unable to open the file. Try using a different backend by installing PyAV ( pip install av ) and see if the problem persists. This can also happen due to videos having multiple audio tracks (as per #179 ).

Compatible With Many External Tools The detected scene boundaries/cuts can be exported in a variety of formats, with the default type (comma-separated HH:MM:SS.nnn values) being ready to copy-and-paste directly into other tools (such as ffmpeg, mkvmerge, etc...) for splitting and/or re-encoding the video. Statistical Video Analysis Can output a spreadsheet-compatible file for analyzing trends in a particular video file, to determine the optimal threshold values to use with specific scene detection methods/algorithms. Extendible and Embeddable Written in Python, and designed with an easy-to-use and extendable API, PySceneDetect is ideal for embedding into other programs, or to implement custom methods/algorithms of scene detection for specific applications (e.g. analyzing security camera footage). Features exports list of scenes to .CSV file and terminal (both timecodes and frame numbers) with list-scenes command exports timecodes in standard format (HH:MM:SS.nnn), comma-separated for easy copy-and-paste into external tools and analysis with spreadsheet software statistics/analysis mode to export frame-by-frame video metrics via the -s [FILE] / --stats [FILE] argument (e.g. --stats metrics.csv ) output-suppression (quiet) mode for better automation with external scripts/programs ( -q / --quiet ) save an image of the first and last frame of each detected scene via the save-images command split the input video automatically if ffmpeg or mkvmerge is available via the split-video command Detection Methods PySceneDetect implements a variety of different detection algorithms which can be used independently or combined depending on the source material being analyzed. adaptive content scene detection ( detect-adaptive ): uses rolling average of differences in HSL colorspace combined with thresholding to detect shot changes (fast cut) content-aware scene detection ( detect-content ): uses differences in HSL colorspace combined with filtering to detect shot changes (fast cut) content-aware scene detection ( detect-hash ): uses perceptual hashing to determine differences between frames to find shot changes (fast cut) content-aware scene detection ( detect-hist ): uses differences in histograms of Y channel of frames after conversion to YUV (fast cut) threshold scene detection ( detect-threshold ): uses average frame intensity (brightness) to detect slow transitions (fade in/out) By default, detection methods are tuned to provide high performance during processing, while maintaining reasonable accuracy.
