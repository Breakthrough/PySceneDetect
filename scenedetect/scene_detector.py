""" ``scenedetect.scene_detector`` Module

This module implements the base SceneDetector class, from which all scene
detectors in the scenedetect.dectectors module are derived from.

The SceneDetector class represents the interface which detection algorithms
are expected to provide in order to be compatible with PySceneDetect.
