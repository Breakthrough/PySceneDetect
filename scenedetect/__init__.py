""" ``scenedetect`` Module

This is the main PySceneDetect module, containing imports of all classes
so they can be directly accessed from the scenedetect module in addition
to being directly imported (e.g. `from scenedetect import FrameTimecode`
is the same as `from scenedetect.frame_timecode import FrameTimecode`).

This file also contains the PySceneDetect version string (displayed when calling
'scenedetect version'), the about string for license/copyright information
(when calling 'scenedetect about').
"""

# Commonly used classes for easier use directly from the scenedetect namespace (e.g.
# scenedetect.SceneManager instead of scenedetect.scene_manager.SceneManager).
from scenedetect.scene_manager import SceneManager
from scenedetect.frame_timecode import FrameTimecode
from scenedetect.video_stream import VideoStream
from scenedetect.stats_manager import StatsManager

# Used for module identification and when printing version & about info
# (e.g. calling `scenedetect version` or `scenedetect about`).
__version__ = 'v0.6-dev'
# About & copyright message string shown for the 'about' CLI command (scenedetect about).

If included with your distribution of PySceneDetect, see the included
LICENSE-FFMPEG and LICENSE-MKVMERGE or visit:
  [ https://pyscenedetect.readthedocs.io/en/latest/copyright/ ]

FFmpeg and mkvmerge are distributed only with certain PySceneDetect
releases, in order to allow for automatic video splitting capability.
If they were not included with your distribution, they can usually be
installed from your operating system's package manager, or downloaded
from the following URLs:

    FFmpeg:   [ https://ffmpeg.org/download.html ]
    mkvmerge: [ https://mkvtoolnix.download/downloads.html ]
        (Note that mkvmerge is a part of the mkvtoolnix package.)

Once installed, ensure the respective program can be accessed from the
same location running PySceneDetect by calling the `ffmpeg` or
`mkvmerge` command from a terminal/command prompt.

PySceneDetect will automatically use whichever program is available on
the computer, depending on the specified command-line options.

Additionally, certain Windows distributions may include a compiled
Python distribution. For license information regarding the distributed
version of Python, see the included LICENSE-PYTHON file for details,
or visit the following URL: [ https://docs.python.org/3/license.html ]

# TODO(v1.0): Add a high level `get_scenes` / `get_cuts` function which acts like the API test.
# Only take in a video path, statsfile, threshold, min_scene_len, fps, and an optional detector.
