""" PySceneDetect `scenedetect` Module

This is the main PySceneDetect module, containing imports of all classes
so they can be directly accessed from the scenedetect module in addition
to being directly imported (e.g. `from scenedetect import FrameTimecode`
is the same as `from scenedetect.frame_timecode import FrameTimecode`).

This file also contains the PySceneDetect version string (displayed when calling
'scenedetect version'), the about string for license/copyright information
(when calling 'scenedetect about').

# PySceneDetect Library Imports

# Commonly used classes for easier use directly from the scenedetect namespace (e.g.
# scenedetect.SceneManager instead of scenedetect.scene_manager.SceneManager).

from scenedetect.scene_manager import SceneManager
from scenedetect.frame_timecode import FrameTimecode
from scenedetect.video_manager import VideoManager
from scenedetect.detectors import ThresholdDetector, ContentDetector
from scenedetect.__main__ import main


# Used for module identification and when printing version & about info.
# (scenedetect version and scenedetect about)

__version__ = 'v0.5'

# About & copyright message string shown for the 'about' CLI command (scenedetect about).

This software may also invoke the following third-party executables:

If included with your distribution of PySceneDetect, see the included
LICENSE-FFMPEG and LICENSE-MKVMERGE files for details.

FFmpeg and mkvmerge are distributed only with certain PySceneDetect
releases, in order to allow for automatic video splitting capability.
If they were not included with your distribution, they can usually be
installed from your operating system's package manager, or downloaded
from the following URLs:

    FFmpeg:   [ https://ffmpeg.org/download.html ]
    mkvmerge: [ https://mkvtoolnix.download/downloads.html ]
        (Note that mkvmerge is a part of the mkvtoolnix package.)

Once installed, ensure the respective program can be accessed from the
same location running PySceneDetect by calling the `ffmpeg` or
`mkvmerge` command from a terminal/command prompt.

PySceneDetect will automatically use whichever program is available on
the computer, depending on the specified command-line options.

Additionally, certain Windows distributions may include a compiled
Python distribution. For license information regarding the distributed
version of Python, see the included LICENSE-PYTHON file for details,
