""" PySceneDetect `scenedetect.__main__` Module

Provides entry point for PySceneDetect's command-line interface (CLI)
functionality (in addition to using in other scripts via `import scenedetect`)
by installing the module and running the `scenedetect` command, or by calling:

  > python -m scenedetect

This module provides a high-level main() function, utilizing the scenedetect.cli
module, itself based on the click library, to provide command-line interface (CLI)
parsing functionality.  Also note that a convenience script scenedetect.py is also
included for development purposes (allows ./scenedetect.py vs python -m scenedetect)

Installing PySceneDetect (using `python setup.py install` in the parent directory)
will also add the `scenedetect` command to %PATH% be used from anywhere.
