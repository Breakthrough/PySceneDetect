"""``scenedetect.detectors.hash_detector`` Module

This module implements the :py:class:`HashDetector`, which calculates a hash
value for each from of a video using a perceptual hashing algorithm. Then, the
differences in hash value between frames is calculated. If this difference
exceeds a set threshold, a scene cut is triggered.

This detector is available from the command-line interface by using the
`detect-hash` command.

class HashDetector(SceneDetector):
    """Detects cuts using a perceptual hashing algorithm. Applies a direct cosine transform (DCT)
    and lowpass filter, followed by binary thresholding on the median. See references below:

    Arguments:
        threshold: Value from 0.0 and 1.0 representing the relative hamming distance between
            the perceptual hashes of adjacent frames. A distance of 0 means the image is the same,
            and 1 means no correlation. Smaller threshold values thus require more correlation,
            making the detector more sensitive. The hamming distance is divided by `size` x `size`
            before comparing to `threshold` for normalization.
        size: Size of square of low frequency data to use for the DCT
        lowpass:  How much high frequency information to filter from the DCT. A value of 2 means
            keep lower 1/2 of the frequency data, 4 means only keep 1/4, etc...
        min_scene_len: Minimum length of any given scene, in frames (int) or FrameTimecode
