""" PySceneDetect `scenedetect.detectors` Module

This module contains implementations of scene detection algorithms by inhereting
from the base SceneDetector class (in scenedetect.scene_detector) and implementing
the required methods. This allows implementation of other generic algorithms as
well as custom scenario-specific algorithms.

Individual detectors are imported in this file for easy access from other
modules (i.e. from scenedetect.detectors import ContentDetector).
