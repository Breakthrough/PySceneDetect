"""``scenedetect.detectors`` Module

This module contains the following scene detection algorithms:

 * :mod:`ContentDetector <scenedetect.detectors.content_detector>`:
    Detects shot changes by considering pixel changes in the HSV colorspace.

 * :mod:`ThresholdDetector <scenedetect.detectors.threshold_detector>`:
    Detects transitions below a set pixel intensity (cuts or fades to black).

 * :mod:`AdaptiveDetector <scenedetect.detectors.adaptive_detector>`:
    Two-pass version of `ContentDetector` that handles fast camera movement better in some cases.

Detection algorithms are created by implementing the
:class:`SceneDetector <scenedetect.scene_detector.SceneDetector>` interface. Detectors are
typically attached to a :class:`SceneManager <scenedetect.scene_manager.SceneManager>` when
processing videos, however they can also be used to process frames directly.
