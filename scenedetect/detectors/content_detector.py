""" Module: ``scenedetect.detectors.content_detector``

This module implements the :py:class:`ContentDetector`, which compares the
difference in content between adjacent frames against a set threshold/score,
which if exceeded, triggers a scene cut.

This detector is available from the command-line interface by using the
`detect-content` command.
