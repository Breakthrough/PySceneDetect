""" PySceneDetect Unit Test Suite

To run all available tests run `pytest -v` from the parent directory
(i.e. the root project folder of PySceneDetect containing the scenedetect/
and tests/ folders).  This will automatically find and run all of the
test cases in the tests/ folder and display the results.
