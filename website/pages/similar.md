The following is a list of programs or commands also performing scene cut analysis of some kind on video files. [Additions/contributions to this list are welcome](contributing.md).

 - [Scenecut Extractor](https://github.com/slhck/scenecut-extractor) - uses ffmpeg `select` filter
 - ffmpeg `blackframe` filter ([thanks @tonycpsu](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/7)) - threshold mode only
 - [Shotdetect](http://johmathe.name/shotdetect.html) - appears to be only for *NIX, content mode only
 - [Matlab Scene Change Detection](http://www.mathworks.com/help/vision/examples/scene-change-detection.html) - requires Matlab and Simulink/Computer Vision Toolbox, uses feature extraction and edge detection
 - [chaptertool](https://github.com/Mtillmann/chaptertool) - CLI/Web tool that converts PySceneDetect output to other formats
 - [TransNetV2](https://github.com/soCzech/TransNetV2) - Shot Boundary Detection Neural Network (2020)
 - [AutoShot] https://github.com/wentaozhu/AutoShot - Shot Boundary Detection Neural Network, based on a neural architecture search (2023)
