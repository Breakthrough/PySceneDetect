PySceneDetect Releases
==========================================================

## PySceneDetect 0.5

### 0.5.5


#### Release Notes

 * Primarily maintenance release including various bugfixes
 * Removed first row from statsfiles so it is a valid CSV file

#### Changelog

 * Removed first row from statsfile to comply with RFC 4180, includes backwards compatibility so existing statsfiles can still be loaded (resolves #136)
 * Removed now unused argument base_timecode from StatsManager.load_from_csv() method

#### Known Issues

 * Variable framerate videos are not supported properly currently (#168), a warning may be added in the next release to indicate when a VFR video is detected, until this can be properly resolved ([#168](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/168))
 * In certain cases, video files which will not load will fail silently, with PySceneDetect reporting that it processed 0 frames.  Better error handling/messaging is planned for these cases as part of [#179](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/179)



### 0.5.4 (September 14, 2020) &nbsp;<span class="fa fa-tags"></span>

#### Release Notes

 * Improved performance when using `time` and `save-images` commands
 * Improved performance of `detect-threshold` when using a small minimum percent
 * Fix crash when using `detect-threshold` with a statsfile
 * Fix crash when using `save-images` command under Python 2.7
 * Support for Python 3.3 and 3.4 has been deprecated (see below)

#### Changelog

 * [bugfix] fix `detect-threshold` crash when using statsfile ([#122](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/122))
 * [bugfix] fix `save-images` command under Python 2.7 ([#174](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/174), thanks @santiagodemierre)
 * [bugfix] gracefully exit and show link to FAQ when number of scenes is too large to split with mkvmerge on Windows (see [#164](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/164, thanks @alexboydray)
 * [enhancement] Improved seeking performance, greatly improves performance of the `time` and `save-images` commands ([#98](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/98) and [PR #163](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/pull/163) - thanks @obroomhall)
 * [enhancement] improve `detect-threshold` performance when min-percent is less than 50%
 * [general] Made `tqdm` a regular requirement and not an extra ([#180](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/180))
 * [general] Support for Python 3.3 and 3.4 has been deprecated. Newer builds may still work on these Python versions, but future releases are not tested against these versions. This decision was made as part of [#180](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/180)

#### Known Issues

 * Variable framerate videos are not supported properly currently (#168), a warning may be added in the next release to indicate when a VFR video is detected, until this can be properly resolved ([#168](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/168))
 * In certain cases, video files which will not load will fail silently, with PySceneDetect reporting that it processed 0 frames.  Better error handling/messaging is planned for these cases as part of [#179](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/179)


### 0.5.3 (July 12, 2020)

#### Release Notes

 * Resolved long-standing bug where `split-video` command would duplicate certain frames at the beginning/end of the output ([#93](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/93))
 * This was determined to be caused by copying (instead of re-encoding) the audio track, causing extra frames to be brought in when the audio samples did not line up on a frame boundary (thank you @joshcoales for your assistance)
 * Default behavior is to now re-encode audio tracks using the `aac` codec when using `split-video` (it can be overriden in both the command line and Python interface)
 * Improved timestamp accuracy when using `split-video` command to further reduce instances of duplicated or off-by-one frame issues
 * Fixed application crash when using the `-l`/`--logfile` argument

#### Changelog

 * [bugfix] Changed default audio codec from 'copy' to 'aac' when splitting scenes with `ffmpeg` to reduce frequency of frames from next scene showing up at the end of the current one when split using `ffmpeg` (see [#93](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/93), [#159](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/159), and [PR #166](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/pull/166) - thank you everyone for your assistance, especially joshcoales, amvscenes, jelias, and typoman). If this still occurs, please provide any information you can by [filing a new issue on Github](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/new/choose).
  * [enhancement] `video_splitter` module now has completed documentation
  * [bugfix] improve timestamp accuracy using the `split-video` command due to timecode formatting
  * [bugfix] fix crash when supplying `-l`/`--logfile` argument (see [#169](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/169), thanks @typoman)

#### Known Issues

 * Seeking through long videos is inefficient, causing the `time` and `save-images` command to take a long time to run.  This will be resolved in the next release (see [#98](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/98))
 * The `save-images` command causes PySceneDetect to crash under Python 2.7 (see [#174](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/174))
 * Using `detect-threshold` with a statsfile causes PySceneDetect to crash (see [#122](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/122))
 * Variable framerate videos are not supported properly currently (#168), a warning may be added in the next release to indicate when a VFR video is detected, until this can be properly resolved ([#168](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/168))
 * Videos with multiple audio tracks may not work correctly, see [this comment on #179](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/179#issuecomment-685252441) for a workaround using `ffmpeg` or `mkvmerge`


### 0.5.2 (March 29, 2020)

 * [enhancement] `--min-duration` now accepts a timecode in addition to frame number ([#128](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/pull/128), thanks @tonycpsu)
 * [feature] Add `--image-frame-margin` option to `save-images` command to ignore a number of frames at the start/end of a scene ([#129](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/pull/129), thanks @tonycpsu)
 * [bugfix] `--min-scene-len` option was not respected by first scene ([#105](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/105), thanks @charlesvestal)
 * [bugfix] Splitting videos with an analyzed duration only splits within analyzed area ([#106](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/106), thanks @charlesvestal)
 * [bugfix] Improper start timecode applied to the `split-video` command when using `ffmpeg` ([#93](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/93), thanks @typoman)
 * [bugfix] Added links and filename sanitation to html output ([#139](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/139) and [#140](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/140), thanks @wsj018)
 * [bugfix] UnboundLocalError in `detect_scenes` when `frame_skip` is larger than 0 ([#126](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/126), thanks @twostarxx)

 * [enhance] When no scenes are detected, the whole video is now returned instead of nothing (thanks [@piercus](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/pull/89))
 * Removed Windows installer due to binary packages now being available, and to streamline the release process (see [#102](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/102) for more information).
