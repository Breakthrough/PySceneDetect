PySceneDetect Releases
==========================================================

## PySceneDetect 0.6

### 0.6.1 (November 28, 2022)

#### Release Notes

Includes [MoviePy support](https://github.com/Zulko/moviepy), edge detection capability for fast cuts, and several enhancements/bugfixes.

#### Changelog

**Command-Line Changes:**

 - [feature] Add `moviepy` backend wrapping the MoviePy package, uses `ffmpeg` binary on the system for video decoding
 - [feature] Edge detection can now be enabled with `detect-content` and `detect-adaptive` to improve accuracy in some cases, especially under lighting changes, see [new `-w`/`--weights` option](http://scenedetect.com/projects/Manual/en/latest/cli/detectors.html#detect-content) for more information
    - A good starting point is to place 100% weight on the change in a frame's hue, 50% on saturation change, 100% on luma (brightness) change, and 25% on change in edges, with a threshold of 32:
    `detect-adaptive -w 1.0 0.5 1.0 0.25`
    - Edge differences are typically larger than other components, so you may need to increase `-t`/`--threshold` higher when increasing the edge weight (the last component) with `detect-content, for example:
    `detect-content -w 1.0 0.5 1.0 0.25 -t 32`
    - May be enabled by default in the future once it has been more thoroughly tested, further improvements for `detect-content` are being investigated as well (e.g. motion compensation, flash suppression)
   - Short-form of `detect-content` option `--frame-window` has been changed from `-w` to `-f` to accomodate this change
 - [enhancement] Progress bar now displays number of detections while processing, no longer conflicts with log message output
 - [enhancement] When using ffmpeg to split videos, `-map 0` has been added to the default arguments so other audio tracks are also included when present ([#271](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/271))
 - [enhancement] Add `-a` flag to `version` command to print more information about versions of dependencies/tools being used
 - [enhancement] The resizing method used used for frame downscaling or resizing can now be set using [a config file](http://scenedetect.com/projects/Manual/en/latest/cli/config_file.html), see `[global]` option `downscale-method` and `[save-images]` option `scale-method`
 - [other] Linear interpolation is now used as the default downscaling method (previously was nearest neighbor) for improved edge detection accuracy
 - [other] Add `-c`/`--min-content-val` argument to `detect-adaptive`, deprecate `-d`/`--min-delta-hsv`

**General:**

 - [general] Recommend `detect-adaptive` over `detect-content`
 - [feature] Add new backend `VideoStreamMoviePy` using the MoviePy package`
 - [feature] Add edge detection to `ContentDetector` and `AdaptiveDetector` ([#35](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/35))
    - Add ability to specify content score weights of hue, saturation, luma, and edge differences between frames
    - Default remains as `1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0` so there is no change in behavior
    - Kernel size used for improving edge overlap can also be customized
 - [feature] `AdaptiveDetector` no longer requires a `StatsManager` and can now be used with `frame_skip` ([#283](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/283))
 - [bugfix] Fix `scenedetect.detect()` throwing `TypeError` when specifying `stats_file_path`
 - [bugfix] Fix off-by-one error in end event timecode when `end_time` was set (reported end time was always one extra frame)
 - [bugfix] Fix a named argument that was incorrect ([#299](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/299))
 - [enhancement] Add optional `start_time`, `end_time`, and `start_in_scene` arguments to `scenedetect.detect()` ([#282](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/282))
 - [enhancement] Add `-map 0` option to default arguments of `split_video_ffmpeg` to include all audio tracks by default ([#271](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/271))
 - [docs] Add example for [using a callback](http://scenedetect.com/projects/Manual/en/v0.6.1/api/scene_manager.html#usage) ([#273](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/273))
 - [enhancement] Add new `VideoCaptureAdapter` to make existing `cv2.VideoCapture` objects compatible with a `SceneManager` ([#276](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/276))
    - Primary use case is for handling input devices/webcams and gstreamer pipes, [see updated examples](http://scenedetect.com/projects/Manual/en/latest/api/backends.html#devices-cameras-pipes)
    - Files, image sequences, and network streams/URLs should continue to use `VideoStreamCv2`
 - [api] The `SceneManager` methods `get_cut_list()` and `get_event_list()` are deprecated, along with the `base_timecode` argument
 - [api] The `base_timecode` argument of `get_scenes_from_cuts()` in `scenedetect.stats_manager` is deprecated (the signature of this function has been changed accordingly)
 - [api] Rename `AdaptiveDetector` constructor parameter `min_delta_hsv` to `min_content_val
 - [general] The default `crf` for `split_video_ffmpeg` has been changed from 21 to 22 to match command line default
 - [enhancement] Add `interpolation` property to `SceneManager` to allow setting method of frame downscaling, use linear interpolation by default (previously nearest neighbor)
 - [enhancement] Add `interpolation` argument to `save_images` to allow setting image resize method (default remains bicubic)

### 0.6 (May 29, 2022)

#### Release Notes

PySceneDetect v0.6 is a **major breaking change** including better performance, configuration file support, and a more ergonomic API.  The new **minimum Python version is now 3.6**. See the [Migration Guide](https://scenedetect.com/projects/Manual/en/latest/api/migration_guide.html) for information on how to port existing applications to the new API.  Most users will see performance improvements after updating, and changes to the command-line are not expected to break most workflows.

The main goals of v0.6 are reliability and performance. To achieve this required several breaking changes.  The video input API was refactored, and *many* technical debt items were addressed. This should help the eventual transition to the first planned stable release (v1.0) where the goal is an improved scene detection API.

Both the Windows installer and portable distributions now include signed executables. Many thanks to SignPath, AppVeyor, and AdvancedInstaller for their support.

#### Changelog

**Overview:**

 * Major performance improvements on multicore systems
 * [Configuration file support](http://scenedetect.com/projects/Manual/en/latest/cli/config_file.html) via command line option or user settings folder
 * Support for multiple video backends, PyAV is now supported in addition to OpenCV
 * Breaking API changes to `VideoManager` (replaced with `VideoStream`), `StatsManager`, and `save_images()`
    * See the [Migration Guide](https://scenedetect.com/projects/Manual/en/latest/api/migration_guide.html) for details on how to update from v0.5.x
    * A backwards compatibility layer has been added to prevent most applications from breaking, will be removed in a future release
 * Support for Python 2.7 has been dropped, minimum supported Python version is 3.6

 * Add `-b`/`--backend` option to use a specific video decoding backend
     * Supported backends are `opencv` and `pyav`
     * Run `scenedetect help` to see a list of backends available on the current system
     * Both backends are included with Windows builds
 * `split-video` command:
     * `-c`/`--copy` now uses `ffmpeg` instead of `mkvmerge` ([#77](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/77), [#236](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/236))
     * Add `-m`/`--mkvmerge` flag to use `mkvmerge` instead of `ffmpeg` ([#77](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/77))
     * Long name for `-a` has been changed to `--args` (from `--override-args`)
 * `detect-adaptive` command:
     * `--drop-short-scenes` now works properly with `detect-adaptive`
 * `detect-content` command:
     * Default threshold `-t`/`--threshold` lowered to 27 to be more sensitive to shot changes ([#246](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/246))
     * Add override for global `-m`/`--min-scene-len` option
 * `detect-threshold` command:
     * Remove `-p`/`--min-percent` and `-b`/`--block-size` options
     * Add override for global `-m`/`--min-scene-len` option
 * `save-images` command now works when `-i`/`--input` is an image sequences

 * `-l`/`--logfile` now respects `-o`/`--output`
 * `-v`/`--verbosity` now takes precedence over `-q`/`--quiet`

**API Changes:**

 * New `detect()` function performs scene detection on a video path, [see example here](http://scenedetect.com/projects/Manual/en/latest/api.html#quickstart)
 * New `open_video()` function to handle video input, [see example here](http://scenedetect.com/projects/Manual/en/latest/api.html#example)

    * Supports both OpenCV (`VideoStreamCv2`) and PyAV (`VideoStreamAv`)
    * Improves video seeking invariants, especially around defining what frames 0 and 1 mean for different time properties (`frame_number` is 1-based whereas `position` is 0-based to align with PTS)
    * See `test_time_invariants` in `tests/test_video_stream.py` as a reference of specific behaviours
 * Changes to `SceneManager`:
    * `detect_scenes()` now performs video decoding in a background thread, improving performance on most systems
    * `SceneManager` is now responsible for frame downscaling via the `downscale`/`auto_downscale` properties
    * `detect_scenes()` no longer shows a progress bar by default, set `show_progress=True` to restore the previous behaviour
    * `clear()` now clears detectors, as they may be stateful
    * `get_scene_list()` now returns an empty list if there are no detected cuts, specify `start_in_scene=True` for previous behavior (one scene spanning the entire input)
 * Changes to `StatsManager`:
    * `save_to_csv()` now accepts a path or an open file handle
    * `base_timecode` argument has been removed from `save_to_csv()`
    * `load_from_csv()` is now deprecated and will be removed in v1.0
 * Changes to `FrameTimecode`:
    * Use rounding instead of truncation when calculating frame numbers to fix incorrect round-trip conversions and improve accuracy ([#268](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/268))
    * Fix `previous_frame()` generating negative frame numbers in some cases
    * `FrameTimecode` objects can now perform arithmetic with formatted strings, e.g. `'HH:MM:SS.nnn'`
 * Merged constants `MAX_FPS_DELTA` and `MINIMUM_FRAMES_PER_SECOND_DELTA_FLOAT` in `scenedetect.frame_timecode` into new `MAX_FPS_DELTA` constant
 * `video_manager` parameter has been removed from the `AdaptiveDetector` constructor
 * `split_video_ffmpeg` and `split_video_mkvmerge` function arguments have been renamed and defaults updated:
    * `suppress_output` is now `show_output`, default is `False`
    * `hide_progress` is now `show_progress`, default is `False`
 * `block_size` argument has been removed from the `ThresholdDetector` constructor
 * `calculate_frame_score` method of `ContentDetector` has been renamed to `_calculate_frame_score`, use new module-level function of the same name instead
 * `get_aspect_ratio` has been removed from `scenedetect.platform` (use the `aspect_ratio` property of a `VideoStream` instead)
 * Backwards compatibility with v0.5 to avoid breaking most applications on release while still allowing performance improvements

#### Python Distribution Changes

 * *v0.6.0.3* - Fix missing package description
 * *v0.6.0.2* - Improve error messaging when OpenCV is not installed
 * *v0.6.0.1* - Fix original v0.6 release requiring `av` to run the `scenedetect` command

#### Known Issues

 * URL inputs are not supported by the `save-images` or `split-video` commands
 * Variable framerate videos (VFR) are not fully supported, and will yield incorrect timestamps ([#168](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/168))
 * The `detect-threshold` option `-l`/`--add-last-scene` cannot be disabled
 * Due to a switch from EXE to MSI for the Windows installer, you may have to uninstall older versions first before installing v0.6


----------------------------------------------------------------

### 0.5.6.1 (October 11, 2021)

 * Fix crash when using `detect-content` or `detect-adaptive` with latest version of OpenCV (thanks @bilde2910)


### 0.5.6 (August 15, 2021)

#### Release Notes

 * Images generated by `save-images` can now be resized via the command line
 * Statsfiles now work properly with `detect-threshold`
 * Removed the `-p`/`--min-percent` option from `detect-threshold`

     * Images can be resized by a constant scaling factory using `-s`/`--scale` (e.g. `--scale 0.5` shrinks the height/width by half)
     * Images can be resized to a specified height (`-h`/`--height`) and/or width (`-w`/`--width`), in pixels; if only one is specified, the aspect ratio of the original video is kept
 * [api] Calling `seek()` on a `VideoManager` will now respect the end time if set
 * [api] The `split_video_` functions now return the exit code of invoking `ffmpeg` or `mkvmerge` ([#209](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/209), thanks  @AdrienLF)
 * [api] Removed the `min_percent` argument from `ThresholdDetector` as was not providing any performance benefit for the majority of use cases ([#178](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/178))
 * [bugfix] The `detect-threshold` command now works properly with a statsfile ([#211](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/211), thanks @jeremymeyers)

 * The `-l`/`--add-last-scene` option in `detect-threshold` cannot be disabled
 * Image sequences or URL inputs are not supported by the `save-images` or `split-video` commands (in v0.6 `save-images` works with image sequences)
 * Due to the use of truncation for frame number calculation, FrameTimecode objects may be off-by-one when constructed using a float value ([#268](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/268), fixed in v0.6)


### 0.5.5 (January 17, 2021)

#### Release Notes

 * Under the `save-images` command, renamed `--image-frame-margin` to `--frame-margin`, added short option `-m`, and increased the default value from 0 to 1 due to instances of the last frame of a video being occasionally missed (set `-m 0` to restore original behaviour)

#### Changelog

 * [bugfix] Allow image sequences and URLs to be used as inputs ([#152](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/171) and [#188](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/188))

#### Known Issues

 * Certain non-PyPI OpenCV packages may cause a crash with the message `TypeError: isinstance() arg 2 must be a type or tuple of types` - as a workaround, install the Python OpenCV package by running `pip install scenedetect[opencv]` ([#220](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/220))
 * Image sequences or URL inputs are not supported by the `save-images` or `split-video` commands
 * Variable framerate videos (VFR) are not fully supported, and will yield incorrect timestamps ([#168](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/168))

 * Improved performance of `detect-threshold` when using a small minimum percent
 * Fix crash when using `detect-threshold` with a statsfile
 * Fix crash when using `save-images` command under Python 2.7
 * Support for Python 3.3 and 3.4 has been deprecated (see below)

#### Changelog

 * [bugfix] fix `detect-threshold` crash when using statsfile ([#122](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/122))
 * [bugfix] fix `save-images` command under Python 2.7 ([#174](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/174), thanks @santiagodemierre)
 * [bugfix] gracefully exit and show link to FAQ when number of scenes is too large to split with mkvmerge on Windows (see [#164](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/164, thanks @alexboydray)
 * [enhancement] Improved seeking performance, greatly improves performance of the `time` and `save-images` commands ([#98](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/98) and [PR #163](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/pull/163) - thanks @obroomhall)
 * [enhancement] improve `detect-threshold` performance when min-percent is less than 50%
 * [bugfix] Fixed issue where video loading would fail silently due to multiple audio tracks ([#179](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/179))
 * [general] Made `tqdm` a regular requirement and not an extra ([#180](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/180))
 * [general] Support for Python 3.3 and 3.4 has been deprecated. Newer builds may still work on these Python versions, but future releases are not tested against these versions. This decision was made as part of [#180](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/180)

#### Known Issues

 * Variable framerate videos are not supported properly currently (#168), a warning may be added in the next release to indicate when a VFR video is detected, until this can be properly resolved ([#168](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/168))


### 0.5.3 (July 12, 2020)

#### Release Notes

 * Resolved long-standing bug where `split-video` command would duplicate certain frames at the beginning/end of the output ([#93](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/93))
 * This was determined to be caused by copying (instead of re-encoding) the audio track, causing extra frames to be brought in when the audio samples did not line up on a frame boundary (thank you @joshcoales for your assistance)
 * Default behavior is to now re-encode audio tracks using the `aac` codec when using `split-video` (it can be overriden in both the command line and Python interface)
 * Improved timestamp accuracy when using `split-video` command to further reduce instances of duplicated or off-by-one frame issues
 * Fixed application crash when using the `-l`/`--logfile` argument

#### Changelog

 * [bugfix] Changed default audio codec from 'copy' to 'aac' when splitting scenes with `ffmpeg` to reduce frequency of frames from next scene showing up at the end of the current one when split using `ffmpeg` (see [#93](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/93), [#159](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/159), and [PR #166](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/pull/166) - thank you everyone for your assistance, especially joshcoales, amvscenes, jelias, and typoman). If this still occurs, please provide any information you can by [filing a new issue on Github](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/new/choose).
  * [enhancement] `video_splitter` module now has completed documentation
  * [bugfix] improve timestamp accuracy using the `split-video` command due to timecode formatting
  * [bugfix] fix crash when supplying `-l`/`--logfile` argument (see [#169](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/169), thanks @typoman)

#### Known Issues

 * Seeking through long videos is inefficient, causing the `time` and `save-images` command to take a long time to run.  This will be resolved in the next release (see [#98](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/98))
 * The `save-images` command causes PySceneDetect to crash under Python 2.7 (see [#174](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/174))
 * Using `detect-threshold` with a statsfile causes PySceneDetect to crash (see [#122](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/122))
 * Variable framerate videos are not supported properly currently (#168), a warning may be added in the next release to indicate when a VFR video is detected, until this can be properly resolved ([#168](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/168))
 * Videos with multiple audio tracks may not work correctly, see [this comment on #179](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/179#issuecomment-685252441) for a workaround using `ffmpeg` or `mkvmerge`


### 0.5.2 (March 29, 2020)

 * [enhancement] `--min-duration` now accepts a timecode in addition to frame number ([#128](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/pull/128), thanks @tonycpsu)
 * [feature] Add `--image-frame-margin` option to `save-images` command to ignore a number of frames at the start/end of a scene ([#129](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/pull/129), thanks @tonycpsu)
 * [bugfix] `--min-scene-len` option was not respected by first scene ([#105](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/105), thanks @charlesvestal)
 * [bugfix] Splitting videos with an analyzed duration only splits within analyzed area ([#106](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/106), thanks @charlesvestal)
