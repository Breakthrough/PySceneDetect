### 0.5.5 (January 17, 2021) &nbsp;<span class="fa fa-tags"></span>

#### Release Notes

 * One of the last major updates before transitioning to the new v0.6.x API
 * The `--min-scene-len`/`-m` option is now global rather than per-detector
 * There is a new global option `--drop-short-scenes` to go along with `-m`
 * Removed first row from statsfiles so it is a valid CSV file
 * The progress bar now correctly resizes when the terminal is resized
 * Image sequences and URLs are now supported for input via the CLI/API

 * The functionality of `save-images` is now accessible via the Python API through the `save_images()` function in `scenedetect.scene_manager`
 * Under the `save-images` command, renamed `--image-frame-margin` to `--frame-margin`, added short option `-m`, and increased the default value from 0 to 1 due to instances of the last frame of a video being occasionally missed (set `-m 0` to restore original behaviour)

#### Changelog

 * [bugfix] Allow image sequences and URLs to be used as inputs ([#152](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/171) and [#188](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/188))

 * [general] Made `tqdm` a regular requirement and not an extra ([#180](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/180))
 * [general] Support for Python 3.3 and 3.4 has been deprecated. Newer builds may still work on these Python versions, but future releases are not tested against these versions. This decision was made as part of [#180](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/180)

#### Known Issues

 * Variable framerate videos are not supported properly currently (#168), a warning may be added in the next release to indicate when a VFR video is detected, until this can be properly resolved ([#168](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/168))


### 0.5.3 (July 12, 2020)

#### Release Notes

 * Resolved long-standing bug where `split-video` command would duplicate certain frames at the beginning/end of the output ([#93](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/93))
 * This was determined to be caused by copying (instead of re-encoding) the audio track, causing extra frames to be brought in when the audio samples did not line up on a frame boundary (thank you @joshcoales for your assistance)
 * Default behavior is to now re-encode audio tracks using the `aac` codec when using `split-video` (it can be overriden in both the command line and Python interface)
 * Improved timestamp accuracy when using `split-video` command to further reduce instances of duplicated or off-by-one frame issues
 * Fixed application crash when using the `-l`/`--logfile` argument

#### Changelog

 * [bugfix] Changed default audio codec from 'copy' to 'aac' when splitting scenes with `ffmpeg` to reduce frequency of frames from next scene showing up at the end of the current one when split using `ffmpeg` (see [#93](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/93), [#159](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/159), and [PR #166](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/pull/166) - thank you everyone for your assistance, especially joshcoales, amvscenes, jelias, and typoman). If this still occurs, please provide any information you can by [filing a new issue on Github](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/new/choose).
  * [enhancement] `video_splitter` module now has completed documentation
  * [bugfix] improve timestamp accuracy using the `split-video` command due to timecode formatting
  * [bugfix] fix crash when supplying `-l`/`--logfile` argument (see [#169](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/169), thanks @typoman)

#### Known Issues

 * The `save-images` command causes PySceneDetect to crash under Python 2.7 (see [#174](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/174))
 * Using `detect-threshold` with a statsfile causes PySceneDetect to crash (see [#122](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/122))
 * Variable framerate videos are not supported properly currently (#168), a warning may be added in the next release to indicate when a VFR video is detected, until this can be properly resolved ([#168](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/168))
 * Videos with multiple audio tracks may not work correctly, see [this comment on #179](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/179#issuecomment-685252441) for a workaround using `ffmpeg` or `mkvmerge`
