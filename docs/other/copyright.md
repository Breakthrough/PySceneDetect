### FFmpeg and mkvmerge

This software may also invoke mkvmerge or FFmpeg, if available.

FFmpeg is a trademark of Fabrice Bellard.
mkvmerge is Copyright (C) 2005-2016, Matroska.

Certain distributions of PySceneDetect may include the above software;
see the included LICENSE-FFMPEG and LICENSE-MKVMERGE files, or visit the
below URLs for details.  In source distributions of PySceneDetect,
neither mkvmerge nor FFmpeg is not distributed, and requires manual
installation in order to allow automatic video splitting capability.
These programs can be obtained from following URLs (note that mkvmerge
is a part of the MKVToolNix package):

    FFmpeg:   [ https://ffmpeg.org/download.html ]
    mkvmerge: [ https://mkvtoolnix.download/downloads.html ]

Once installed, ensure the program can be accessed system-wide by calling
the `mkvmerge` or `ffmpeg` command from a terminal/command prompt.
PySceneDetect will automatically use whichever program is available on
the computer, depending on the specified command-line options.
