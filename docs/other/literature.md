# PySceneDetect in Literature

PySceneDetect is a useful tool for statistical analysis of video.  Below are links to various research articles/papers which have either used PySceneDetect as a part of their analysis, or propose more accurate detection algorithms using the current implementation as a comparison.

This list is only provided for academic and research purposes, and is far from an exhaustive source of the uses of PySceneDetect in literature.  If you think a particular submission is relevant and should be added to this list, feel free to [raise an issue](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/new/choose) with your suggestion.  Publically available material is preferred, although not a requirement.


# Scene Detection Methodology

You can find the source code for each scene detector in [the scenedetect/detectors folder](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/tree/master/scenedetect/detectors).  Also see [Issue #62: Reference of paper for the methods used](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues/62) on Github for a futher discussion on detection methodologies.  You are more than welcome to propose any new ideas on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues), or share a proof of concept using the Python API by creating a pull request.
