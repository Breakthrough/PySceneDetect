# Obtaining PySceneDetect

PySceneDetect is completely free software, and can be downloaded from the links below.  See the [license and copyright information](copyright.md) page for details.  If you have trouble running PySceneDetect, ensure that you have all the required dependencies listed in the [Dependencies](#dependencies) section below.

PySceneDetect requires at least Python 3.6 or higher.

## Download and Installation

### Post Installation

After installation, you can call PySceneDetect from any terminal/command prompt by typing `scenedetect` (try running `scenedetect help`, or `scenedetect version`).

To get familiar with PySceneDetect, try running `scenedetect help`, or continue onwards to the [Getting Started: Basic Usage](examples/usage.md) section.  If you encounter any runtime errors while running PySceneDetect, ensure that you have all the required dependencies listed in the System Requirements section above (you should be able to `import numpy` and `import cv2`).  If you encounter any issues or want to make a feature request, feel free to [report any bugs or share some feature requests/ideas](contributing.md) on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/issues) and help make PySceneDetect even better.


## Dependencies

### Python Packages

PySceneDetect requires [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) and the following packages:

 - [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/): `pip install opencv-python`
 - [Numpy](https://numpy.org/): `pip install numpy`
 - [Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com): `pip install Click`
 - [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm): `pip install tqdm`
 - [appdirs](https://github.com/ActiveState/appdirs): `pip install appdirs`

Optional packages:

 - [PyAV](https://pyav.org/): `pip install av`

### Video Splitting Tools

For video splitting support, you need to have one of the following tools available (included in Windows builds):

 - [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html), required to split video files (`split-video` or `split-video -c/--copy`)
 - [mkvmerge](https://mkvtoolnix.download/), part of mkvtoolnix, command-line tool, required to split video files in stream copy mode (`split-video -c/--copy` only)

The `ffmpeg` and/or `mkvmerge` command must be available system wide (e.g. in a directory in `PATH`, so it can be used from any terminal/console by typing the command), or alternatively, placed in the same directory where PySceneDetect is installed.  On Windows this is usually `C:\PythonXY\Scripts`, where `XY` is your Python version.

If you have trouble getting PySceneDetect to find `ffmpeg` or `mkvmerge`, see the section on Manually Enabling `split-video` Support on [Getting Started: Video Splitting Support Requirements](examples/video-splitting).

### Building OpenCV from Source

If you have installed OpenCV using `pip`, you will need to uninstall it before installing a different version of OpenCV, or building and installing it from source.

You can [click here](http://breakthrough.github.io/Installing-OpenCV/) for a quick guide (OpenCV + Numpy on Windows & Linux) on installing OpenCV/Numpy on [Windows (using pre-built binaries)](http://breakthrough.github.io/Installing-OpenCV/#installing-on-windows-pre-built-binaries) and [Linux (compiling from source)](http://breakthrough.github.io/Installing-OpenCV/#installing-on-linux-compiling-from-source).  If the Python module that comes with OpenCV on Windows is incompatible with your system architecture or Python version, [see this page](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#opencv) to obtain a pre-compiled (unofficial) module.

To ensure you have all the requirements installed, open a `python` interpreter, and ensure you can run `import numpy` and `import cv2` without any errors.
