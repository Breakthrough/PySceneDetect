# This file contains every possible PySceneDetect config option.
#
# A config file path can be specified via the -c/--config option, or
# creating a `scenedetect.cfg` file the following location:
#
#   Windows: C:/Users/%USERNAME%/AppData/Local/PySceneDetect/scenedetect.cfg
#
#   Linux:   ~/.config/PySceneDetect/scenedetect.cfg
#            $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/scenedetect.cfg
#
#   Mac:     ~/Library/Preferences/PySceneDetect/scenedetect.cfg
#
# Run `scenedetect help` to see the exact path on your system which will be
# used (it will be listed under the help text for the -c/--config option).
